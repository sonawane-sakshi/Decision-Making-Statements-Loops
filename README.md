# Information About Loops In c++
In computer programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code.
For example, let's say we want to show a message 100 times. Then instead of writing the print statement 100 times, we can use a loop.
That was just a simple example; we can achieve much more efficiency and sophistication in our programs by making effective use of loops.

1)For Loop-
A For loop is a repetition control structure that allows us to write a loop that is executed a specific number of times. The loop enables us to perform n number of steps together in one line. 

Syntax: 
for (initialization expr; test expr; update expr)
{    
     // body of the loop
     // statements we want to execute
}
